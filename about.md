Hey there! I'm Albert, this is my personal blog. I usually write about technology, coding and anything ranging from
politics to philosophy. I develop/maintain software at [Scripbox](scripbox.com){:target="_blank"} to earn my bread.
A day dreamer, optimistic nihilist, liberal and atheist. I write here so that I can make notes, share, discuss
the things I find interesting in life.
