I was thinking about writing down all the things I learn/discover for long time, even though I used to have a blog back
in 2011s I really lost the touch. Back then I was really interested in blogging as well as making a bit of money. I had
a blogspot hosted blog then after learning a bit about varioud CMS I created and managed a wordpress based blog. To
be precise it was during my college freshman years and it was really easy to setup one and make money.

Scope of my blogging changed alot since, I created this blog in order for me to keep track of the things I learn 
everyday so that I can always comeback and check it out later, discuss and share the stuff I find interesting.
